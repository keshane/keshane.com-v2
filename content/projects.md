## This site

<https://github.com/keshane/keshane.com-v2>

I'm migrating my Django-based personal site hosted on a virtual private server to one statically built by Hugo so that
it's easier to maintain.

## Birdwidth

<https://birdwidth.com>

Initially a web-based app developed to roll dice after I forgot the dice for the _Wingspan_ board game, it has expanded
to also tally up scores. I have plans to expand this with a strategy blog.

## Wingspan scorer

<https://birdwidth.com/games>

In-progress feature for birdwidth.com to score _Wingspan_ games without doing manual calculations.

## Sudoku

A Sudoku solver set up behind a Google Cloud Function.
