## This site

I'm migrating my Django-based personal site hosted on a virtual private server to one statically built by Hugo so that
it's easier to maintain.

Initially a web-based app developed to roll dice after I forgot the dice for the _Wingspan_ board game, it has expanded
to also tally up scores. I have plans to expand this with a strategy blog.
